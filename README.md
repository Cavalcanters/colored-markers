Learning CSS Colors by building a set of colored markers (FreeCodeCamp)

CSS Color Markers
This repository contains a simple HTML and CSS code that creates three colored markers. The markers are styled using CSS to resemble real-life markers with a cap and a sleeve.

Customization:

Colors: Modify the background and box-shadow properties in the CSS classes .red, .green, and .blue to change the marker colors.
Dimensions: Adjust the width and height values in the CSS classes .marker, .cap, and .sleeve to change the size of the markers.
Styling: Explore other CSS properties to further customize the appearance of the markers, such as border styles, padding, and margins.
